        <p>Good practices for keeping your devices safe from malicious programs!</p>
        <p>I hope these tips are helpful!</p>
        <h2>1. Never use an unattended USB drive</h2>
        <p>Unethical hackers will often leave hacked USBs in conspicuous locations,</p>
        <p>these USBs could inject dangerous code, or even destroy your computer!</p>
        <h3>Mechanics:</h3>
        <p>Some USBs will trick the target computer into thinking the USB is a keyboard or other input device.
             The moment you plug the USB in, it will execute the necessary keystrokes to open a terminal and install a virus in a matter of miliseconds.</p>
        <p>If the hacker is truly a terrible person, they might design a USB that can completely fry your computer. In essence, the USB contains "capacitors" which store an electrical charge. 
            Upon insertion of the USB, it will 'request' for this capacitor to be charged by the computer. It will attempt this several times, before eventually discharging the electrical current into the computer and "bricking" it. </p>
        <h2>2. Avoid connecting to unsecured public WIFI</h2> 
        <p>Public WIFI at places such as Starbucks or McDonalds are often targeted by hackers. These WIFI networks can be used to propagate viruses to any device connected to them, without the network administrators being aware.</p>
        <h1>Be aware, stay aware!</h1>
        <h2>When you risk your device doing dangerous things, you're not only putting yourself at risk, you're also putting those around you at risk!</h2>
        <p>Viruses are very clever. They spread via a plethora of means, including but not limited to: Flash drives, USB charging ports, Bluetooth, File downloads, Image loading, WIFI networks, and direct connections.</p>
        <p>If your device is compromised, it may try to infect anyone else on your network or in your vicinity!</p>
